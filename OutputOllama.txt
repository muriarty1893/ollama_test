There is no definitive timeline for human extinction, as it's a complex and multifaceted topic that depends on various factors. However, I can provide some context and insights based on scientific research and expert opinions.

Some potential scenarios that could lead to human extinction include:

1. **Nuclear war**: A large-scale nuclear conflict could cause widespread destruction, radiation poisoning, and long-term damage to the environment, potentially leading to human extinction.
2. **Climate change**: If left unchecked, climate change could lead to catastrophic consequences such as sea-level rise, droughts, and extreme weather events, making it difficult for humans to survive.
3. **Pandemics**: A highly contagious and deadly disease could spread globally, overwhelming healthcare systems and potentially leading to human extinction.
4. **Artificial intelligence (AI) takeover**: The development of superintelligent AI could potentially lead to an existential risk if the AI is not aligned with human values or becomes uncontrollable.
5. **Asteroid impact**: A large asteroid impact could cause massive destruction, global firestorms, and long-term environmental damage, leading to human extinction.

According to various scientific estimates and expert opinions, here are some potential timelines for these scenarios:

1. **Nuclear war**: Some estimates suggest that a large-scale nuclear conflict could lead to human extinction within 24-48 hours.
2. **Climate change**: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, we may face catastrophic consequences by the mid-21st century, including:
	* Rising sea levels: 2050s-2070s
	* Water scarcity: 2050s-2080s
	* Food insecurity: 2060s-2090s
3. **Pandemics**: The likelihood and potential impact of a pandemic depend on various factors, including the virus's transmissibility, virulence, and the effectiveness of public health measures.
4. **AI takeover**: This scenario is still largely speculative, but some experts estimate that the development of superintelligent AI could happen within the next few decades (2020s-2050s).
5. **Asteroid impact**: The likelihood of a large asteroid impact in the near future is difficult to predict, but some estimates suggest that the chances of a major asteroid impact are low, occurring once every 1,000 years.

It's essential to note that these timelines are uncertain and based on current scientific understanding. Human extinction is not inevitable, and many experts believe that we can mitigate or avoid these risks through collective action, education, and technological advancements.
